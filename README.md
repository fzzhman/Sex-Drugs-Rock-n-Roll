# Sex&Drugs&Rock-n-Roll
A simple project that tracks frequency of profanity in Rock and Roll music from 1940 to present.
Lyrics of the songs classified as "rock and roll" over the past decades (1940s to present) mention words explicitly relating to sex and/or drugs.
As a casual fan of rock music, my (very innocent) assumption is that it has gotten less profane.
